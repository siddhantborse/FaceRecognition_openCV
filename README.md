# ðŸ“¸ Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition
## About the Project
### This project, Smart Attendance System, developed by Siddhant Borse, aims to automate the attendance tracking process through face recognition technology. This solution addresses the challenges of manual attendance, reducing the risk of proxies and the burden on educational staff. By leveraging biometric-based facial recognition, the system offers a secure and efficient method for verifying physical presence.
## âœ¨ Key Features
### Real-Time Face Recognition: Detects multiple faces in a single frame and logs attendance instantly.
Biometric Security: Eliminates fake attendance through reliable face recognition.
Automated Attendance Tracking: Stores attendance records in a database, making manual logging redundant.
Versatile Applications: Suitable for educational institutions, corporate settings, and secured access areas.
## Benefits
### This system is beneficial in educational environments, helping teachers and management teams to streamline attendance processes. It can also be used in other areas such as:

### Video surveillance systems
### Computer-human interaction interfaces
### Access control systems in security-sensitive environments
## Getting Started
### Installation: Set up the required libraries for facial recognition, such as OpenCV and dlib.
### Database Setup: Configure a database to store the attendance records securely.
### Running the System: Execute the code to capture images, recognize faces, and save attendance records.
## Project Structure
### face_recognition.py: The main code for face recognition.
### database_config.py: Configuration settings for the attendance database.
### utils/: Helper functions for image processing and data management.
## How It Works
### The system captures images in real-time, identifies individual faces using biometric facial recognition, and logs their attendance. Multiple faces can be recognized simultaneously, making it highly scalable for larger groups.
