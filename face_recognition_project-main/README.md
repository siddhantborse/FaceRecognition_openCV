# Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition
## About the Project
### This project, Smart Attendance System, developed by Siddhant Borse, aims to automate the attendance tracking process through face recognition technology. This solution addresses the challenges of manual attendance, reducing the risk of proxies and the burden on educational staff. By leveraging biometric-based facial recognition, the system offers a secure and efficient method for verifying physical presence.
